# Statistical-Learning
Welcome to the Statistical Learning with R repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of R code and resources for various aspects of statistical learning, including model building, selection, regularization, classification, and prediction. 

## Basic Ideas
The "Basic Ideas" folder is designed to provide a foundational understanding of statistical learning concepts. Here, you will find resources related to basic linear regression, which is a fundamental building block for more advanced models.

## Linear Models
The "Linear Models" section delves into the world of linear models with a focus on various loss functions. This section explores different techniques for building and optimizing linear models. Whether you're interested in ordinary least squares or robust regression, you'll find valuable information and R code here.

## Neural Networks
In the "Neural Networks" section, we cover principle component analysis (PCA) and basic neural networks. These topics are essential for understanding the fundamentals of deep learning. You'll find code and explanations to help you grasp these concepts and start building your neural network models.

## Tree-Based Methods
The "Tree-Based Methods" section is dedicated to different decision tree methods and how to construct and prune them effectively. Decision trees are powerful tools for both classification and regression tasks. Explore this section to learn about popular algorithms like CART, Random Forests, and XGBoost.

## UltraStat_Learn
The "UltraStat_Learn" combines the learnings from Neural Networks & Tree-Based Methods with paramater tuning.
